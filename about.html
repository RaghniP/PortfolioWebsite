                        <h2>Hi, my name is Raghni P Dalasagere. Thanks for visiting my website!</h2>
                        <p>
                            I am a pro-active engineering student currently studying in AIT,Bangalore. I have experience in web development and
                            everyday I work on honing my skills further. For me everyday is an opportunity to learn more , increase
                            your knowledge and grow. This has been my motto in life for a long time now , if you don't grow everyday, you're taking
                            two steps backward rather than moving ahead.
                            
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            I really enjoy coding and solving problems. I spend my free time participating in competitive programming contests online.
                            I also really love reading in my free time. My favorite genre is suspense-mystery, some of authors I adore are Agatha 
                            Christie and Jeffrey Archer.
