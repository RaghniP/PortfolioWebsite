                <h1>READING</h1>
                <p>Reading has been my hobby ever since I was a kid. It began with Enid Blyton's classics, 'The Secret
                    Seven' series,'St. Claire's' series and many more. As I grew up ,I grew out of children's literature. 
                    Mystery, mythology and fantasy has always intrigued me, these are my favorite genres. Mystery brings an element
                    of surprise, an excitement and increases a readers involvement in the universe which writer creates. 
                    Mythology on the other hand has its own magical way of telling compelling stories, the gods, demigods,
                    demons, other heavenly beings and their heroics, adventures are truly timeless.And fantasy books like the Harry Potter
                    series have beiwtched me in its wonderful universe! I really enjoy books and reading beacause often in the end 
                    it is these stories which we remember and cherish.

                <h1>JOURNALING & WRITING</h1>
                <p>Jim Rohn says, “If you’re serious about becoming a wealthy, powerful, sophisticated, 
                    healthy, influential, cultured, and unique individual, keep a journal.”</p>
                <p>I really enjoy journaling as it not only helps you record of the progress you’ve made towards
                my goals to keep you motivated in the long slog of actually reaching them, but it also helps
                me understand my feelings and the state of my mind at the time. Jounaling helps me to at times 
                take a step back, evaluate things from another perspective and move forward. And ofcourse it is always great to look
                back at wonderful memories, hilarious (and embarassing) stories and deep dive into nostalgia.</p>
