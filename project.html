                    <h1>Cryptography Project</h1>
                    <h2>Brief:</h2>
                    <p>To develop a basic website which implements various cryptographical substitution 
                        techniques , namely </p>
                    <p>1.Caesar Cipher Technique<br>2.Vigenere Cipher Technique<br>3.One time Padding <br>
                        4.Hill Cipher Technique</p>
                    <h2>Execution:</h2>
                    <p>This project was executed using a combination of HTML,CSS and PHP.
                        HTML and CSS was used for front end design. PHP was used to write code for encryption
                        and decryption in various techniques.
                    </p>
                    <h2>Challenges:</h2>
                    <p>The major challenges I faced during this project were:<br>
                        1. I struggled initially to link java/python code for these techniques to our original 
                        html page.<br>
                        2.Hill cipher technique in decryption is perticularly challenging to write as in involves
                        complicated matrix operations.<br>
                        3. Representing these techniques in user friendly manner.<br>
                    </p>
                    <h2>Solutions:</h2>
                    <p>Though there was initial struggle in trying to find ways of integrating different
                        languages with html, I finally came to the conclusion that php is the most effective
                        and easiest way forward for me in the given timeline.<br>
                        Hill cipher decryption code took quite some time, but eventually by consulting experts
                        and some online libraries ,it was smoothly implemented.<br>
                        Front-end development is a creative process,we learn as we go along and with more
                        experience.<br>

                    <h1>DBMS Project</h1>
                    <h2>Brief:</h2>
                    <p>Develop a basic implementation of DBMS which includes,<br>1. Insertion of data into the 
                        database<br>2.Deletion of data from the database<br>3.Manipulation of Data<br>
                        4.implementation of Triggers and Stored procedures</p>
                    <h2>Execution:</h2>
                    <p> Here I developed a databse for Diagnostic Laboratory Management.<br>
                        This project was also executed using HTML and PHP for front-end design.<br>
                       Back-end was implemented using PhpMyAdmin in XAMPP server.<br>
                    </p>
                    <h2>Challenges:</h2>
                    <p>Major challenges I faced while implementing this project was:<br>
                       1.Learning and coding using PHP.(As I was not familiar with it before taking up
                        this project)<br>2.Implementation of stored procedures and triggers.</p>
                    <h2>Solutions:</h2>
                    <p>Leaning PHP mainly with the help of college seniors and youtube tutorials.<br>
                     Stored procedures and triggers were implemented with some guidance from our DBMS
                     teacher and also by learning from various online portals</p>
